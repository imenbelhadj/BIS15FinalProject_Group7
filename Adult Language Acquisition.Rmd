## 0) Cleaning the data
```{r}
#Loading the packages
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(janitor)
library(naniar)
library(dplyr) 
library(ggthemes)
```

```{r}
#install.packages("ggthemes")
```


```{r}
#Load the data
languages <- readr::read_csv("data/stex.csv") 
```
```{r}
# Cleaning Data
languages2<- languages %>% select(-"L1L2") %>% 
  plyr::rename(c("C"="Country", "lex"="Lexicon", "morph"="Morphology","new_feat"="New_Features", "new_sounds"="New_Sounds","Edu.day"="Edu_Days"))
```
 
```{r}
languages2
```

## 1) Where the NAs are:
```{r}
languages2 %>% 
  summarise_all(~(sum(is.na(.))))
```

## 2) Distribution of Sex of Participants
```{r}
languages2 %>% 
  count(Sex) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Sex,y=n, fill=Sex))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x="Sex", y="Number of Participants", title = "Representation in the Study by Sex")+
  theme_clean()
```

## 3) Distribution of Second Language
```{r}
languages2 %>% 
  count(L2) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=L2,y=n, fill=L2))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(x="L2", y="count", title = "Representation of Second Language in the Study Language")+
  scale_y_log10()+
  coord_flip()+
  guides(fill="none")+
  theme_clean()
```

```{r}
languages2 %>%

```


## 8) Top 10 L2 in Netherlands

```{r}
netherlands_languages %>% 
  select(L2) %>% 
  group_by(L2) %>% 
  summarize(n=n()) %>% 
  arrange(-n) #when exploring top 10 L2, find that 223 residents are monolingual

```

## 10) Speaking prof vs. Country & Education Time?
Based off of the top 3 countries that speak the most different amt of L1
Extremes of edu.days (low & very high)

```{r}

  theme_clean()+
  labs(title = "Proficiency Score vs. Country & Daily Education Duration",
       x = "Proficiency Score")
```

## 11) LoR vs Speaking Proficiency

- Looking at number of participants per residency length category
```{r}
languages2 %>% 
  mutate(LoR_Category = case_when(LoR <= 15 ~ "low",
                  LoR > 15 & LoR <= 30 ~ "middle",
                  LoR > 30 & LoR <= 45 ~ "high",
                  LoR > 45 ~ "very high")) %>% 
  count(LoR_Category) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=LoR_Category, y=n, fill=LoR_Category))+
  geom_col(alpha = 0.6)+
  labs(title = "Participants Per Residency Category", x= "Length of Residency", y = "Number of Participants")+
  guides(fill="none")+
  theme_clean()
```

- Looking at spread of speaking score for LoR category with most participants (low)
```{r}
languages2 %>% 
  mutate(LoR_Category = case_when(LoR <= 15 ~ "low",
                  LoR > 15 & LoR <= 30 ~ "middle",
                  LoR > 30 & LoR <= 45 ~ "high",
                  LoR > 45 ~ "very high")) %>% 
  filter(LoR_Category == "low") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Speaking))+
  geom_histogram()+
  labs(title = "Speaking Score Distribution for Low Residency Category", x= "Speaking Score", y = "Number of Participants")+
  guides(fill="none")+
  theme_clean()
```

- Looking at spread of the other residency categories
```{r}
languages2 %>% 
  mutate(LoR_Category = case_when(LoR <= 15 ~ "low",
                  LoR > 15 & LoR <= 30 ~ "middle",
                  LoR > 30 & LoR <= 45 ~ "high",
                  LoR > 45 ~ "very high")) %>% 
  filter(LoR_Category != "low") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Speaking, fill=LoR_Category))+
  geom_histogram(alpha=0.6, bins=60)+
  facet_wrap(.~LoR_Category)+
  labs(title = "Speaking Scores per Residency Category", x= "Speaking Score", y = "Number of Participants")+
  guides(fill="none")+
  theme_clean()
```

## 12) Comparision of new sounds learned vs language family

- average new sounds per language family
```{r}
languages2 %>% 
  filter(!is.na(New_Sounds)) %>% 
  group_by(Family) %>% 
  summarise(avg_new_sounds = mean(New_Sounds, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=reorder(Family, -avg_new_sounds) , y=avg_new_sounds, fill=Family))+
  geom_col(alpha = 0.6)+
  labs(title = "Average New Sounds Learned By Language Family", x= "Language Family", y = "Average Number Of New Sounds")+
  guides(fill="none")+
  theme_clean()+
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 25, hjust = 0.6))
```

- exploring speaking proficiency scores by language family for least and most new sounds, using relative frequency of scores
```{r}
languages2 %>% 
  filter(Family == "Kartvelian" | Family == "Uralic") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=Speaking))+
  geom_histogram(bins = 40, aes(y=after_stat(density), fill=Family), alpha=0.6)+
  facet_wrap(.~Family)+
  labs(title = "Speaking Scores for Family With Least And Most New Sounds", y = "Relative Frequency Of New Sounds")+
  guides(fill="none")+
  theme_clean()
```

## 13) From what countries do people learn Dutch the easiest? (What country has the highest lexicon?)
```{r}
#Highest Lexile(best understanding of new written words on avg):
languages2 %>% 
  group_by(Country) %>% 
  summarise(mean_lexile=mean(Lexicon), na.rm=T) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_lexile)) %>% slice_head()
#Highest Morphology(best knowledge of word structure on avg):
languages2 %>% 
  group_by(Country) %>% 
  summarise(mean_morph=mean(Morphology), na.rm=T) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_morph)) %>% slice_head() 
#Highest Proficiency(best speaking scores on avg):
languages2 %>% 
  group_by(Country) %>% 
  summarise(mean_speaking=mean(Speaking)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_speaking))%>% slice_head()
```

## 14) Do men or women tend to have an easier time learning Dutch on average?
```{r}
languages2 %>%
  filter(Sex=="Female") %>% 
  summarise(mean_speaking=mean(Speaking), mean_morph=mean(Morphology, na.rm=T), mean_lexile=mean(Lexicon), mean_features=mean(New_Features, na.rm = T))
  
```
```{r}
languages2 %>%
  filter(Sex=="Male") %>% 
  summarise(mean_speaking=mean(Speaking), mean_morph=mean(Morphology, na.rm=T), mean_lexile=mean(Lexicon), mean_features=mean(New_Features, na.rm = T))
```
